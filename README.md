# Go Programming Language

I was looking for a new programming language to learn, I started with Python, I found it good for some kind of things and limited for others, then I tried Node.JS but it made me feel like I was losing my time. After some research I found Golang and I immediately felt in love with this programming language, it was created for this particular age, it has very good performance, its code is easy to read and maintain. 

This is a personal repo where I am going to register my journey learning Golang.
