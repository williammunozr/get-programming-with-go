# Go Programming Language

I was looking for a new programming language to learn, I started with Python, but I found it is OK for some tasks and limited for others, then I tried Node.JS, but it made me feel like I was losing my time. After some research I found Golang, and I immediately fell in love with this programming language, was created for this particular age, where it excels is in its performance, its code is easy to read and maintain.

On this repository, I am going to register my journey learning Golang.
