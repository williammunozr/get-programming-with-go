# Golang Programming Adventure

I was looking for a new programming language to learn, I started with Python, I found it good for some kind of things and limited for others, then I tried Node.JS but it made me feel like I was losing my time. After some research I found Golang and I immediately felt in love with this programming language, it was created for this particular age, it has very good performance, its code is easy to read and maintain. This is a personal repo where I am going to register my journey learning Golang.

Learning to program in Golang using the following resources:

- https://golang.org/doc/effective_go.html
- Get Programming with Go
- The Go Programming Language
- Learn Data Structures and Algorithms with Golang
- Learning Functional Programming in Go
